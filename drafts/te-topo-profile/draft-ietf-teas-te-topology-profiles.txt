1.  Introduction

   There are many network scenarios being discussed in various IETF
   Working Groups (WGs) that are not classified as "Traffic Engineering"
   but can be addressed by a sub-set (profile) of the YANG data model,
   defined in [RFC8795].

   Traffic Engineering (TE) is defined in [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc3272bis] as
   aspects of Internet network engineering that deal with the issues of
   performance evaluation and performance optimization of operational IP
   networks.  TE encompasses the application of technology and
   scientific principles to the measurement, characterization, modeling,
   and control of Internet traffic.

Internet-Draft            TE Topology Profiles              October 2025


   The TE Topology Model is augmenting the Network Topology Model
   defined in [RFC8345] with generic and technology-agnostic features,
   some of which are strictly applicable to TE networks, while others
   applicable to both TE and non-TE networks, and therefore could be
   considered as core network topology model constructs.

   Examples of core network topology model constructs supported by the
   YANG data model defined in [RFC8795]: inter-domain link discovery
   (plug-id), and admin/operational status.

   It is also worth noting that also the boundary between the TE-
   specific model constructs and the core network topology model
   constructs is also blurred since new happlications may need to
   leverage on constructs which was originally defined to support TE
   applications but that are also needed to support these new
   applications.

   An example of a concept that originated from TE application but can
   be considered a core network topology model construct is the SRLG.
   New applications such as what-if analysis need to be aware of the
   SRLG information also for non-TE network topologies to provide
   reliable results.

   It is also worth noting that the TE Topology Model is quite an
   extensive and comprehensive model in which most features are
   optional.  Therefore, even though the full model appears to be
   complex, at the first glance, a sub-set of the model (profile) can be
   used to address specific scenarios, e.g. suitable also to non-TE use
   cases.

   The implementation of such TE Topology profiles can simplify and
   expedite adoption of the full TE topology YANG data model, and allow
   for its reuse even for non-TE use case.  The key question being
   whether all or some of the attributes defined in the TE Topology
   Model are needed to address a given network scenario.

   Section 2 provides examples where profiles of the TE Topology Model
   can be used to address some generic use cases applicable to both TE
   and non-TE technologies.

2.  Examples of non-TE scenarios

2.1.  UNI Topology Discovery

   UNI Topology Discovery is independent from whether the network is TE
   or non-TE.

Internet-Draft            TE Topology Profiles              October 2025


   The YANG data model defined in [RFC8795] supports inter-domain link
   discovery (including but not being limited to UNI link discovery)
   using the plug-id attribute.

   The following profile of the YANG data model defined in [RFC8795] can
   be used to support the UNI Topology Discovery:

      module: ietf-te-topology
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types:
          +--rw te-topology!
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point:
          +--rw te-tp-id?   te-types:te-tp-id
          +--rw te!
             +--rw admin-status?
             |       te-types:te-admin-status
             +--rw inter-domain-plug-id?        binary
             +--ro oper-status?                 te-types:te-oper-status

                           Figure 1: UNI Topology

   Note: It would have been more straightforward to understand that the
   solution is generic if the 'inter-domain-plug-id' leaf were defined
   under a container with a different name than 'te' or directly under
   the parent 'termination-point' data node.

   It is also worth noting that the UNI links can also be TE (e.g. an
   OTN UNI) or non-TE (e.g., an Ethernet UNI) as well as multi-function
   UNI links, supporting both TE and non-TE technologies, such as the
   UNI links, described in Section 4.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-transport-nbi-app-statement], which can be configured
   either OTN UNI or Ethernet UNI or SDH UNI.

   The UNI Topology profiled YANG data model shown in Figure 1 can also
   be used with technology-specific UNI augmentations, as described in
   Section 3.  Technology-specific augmentations can for example
   describe the capability of the TP to be configured as a UNI for the
   types of services supported by the UNI (e.g., L2VPN/L3VPN).

   For example, in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-eth-client-te-topo-yang], the eth-svc
   container is defined to represent the capabilities of the Termination
   Point (TP) to be configured as an Ethernet UNI, together with the
   Ethernet classification and VLAN operations supported by that TP.

   The [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang] provides another example, where:

   *  the client-svc container is defined to represent the capabilities
      of the TP to be configured as an transparent client UNI (e.g.,
      STM-N, Fiber Channel or transparent Ethernet);

Internet-Draft            TE Topology Profiles              October 2025


   *  the OTN technology-specific Link Termination Point (LTP)
      augmentations are defined to represent the capabilities of the TP
      to be configured as an OTN UNI, together with the information
      about OTN label and bandwidth availability at the OTN UNI.

   Te UNI Topology profiled YANG data model shown in Figure 1 does not
   require the network to be a TE network and, therefore, it could be
   used as a core network topology model to discover UNIs (or in general
   any external link) for TE and non-TE networks as well as multi-layer
   networks encompassing both TE and non-TE layers.

   The advantages of using the UNI Topology profiled YANG data model
   shown in Figure 1 as a core network topology model is to have a
   common solutions for:

   *  discovering UNIs as well as inter-domain NNI links, which is
      applicable to any technology (TE or non TE) used at the UNI or
      within the network;

   *  modelling non TE UNIs such as Ethernet, and TE UNIs such as OTN,
      as well as UNIs which can configured as TE or non-TE (e.g., being
      configured as either Ethernet or OTN UNI).

2.2.  Administrative and Operational status management

   The management of administrative and operational state is independent
   from whether the network is TE or non-TE.

   The YANG data model defined in [RFC8795] supports the management of
   administrative and operational state for nodes, termination points
   and links.  It also includes the possibility to associate some
   administrative names to network topologies, nodes, termination points
   and links.

   The following profile of the YANG data model defined in [RFC8795] can
   be used for administrative and operational state management:

             +--rw te-link-attributes
             |  +--rw name?                  string

             +--rw name?                     string
             +--ro oper-status?              te-types:te-oper-status

        Figure 2: Generic Topology with admin and operational state

   Note: It would have been more straightforward to understand that the
   solution is generic if the 'name', 'admin-status' and 'oper-status'
   leafs were defined under a container with a different name than 'te'
   (e.g., 'state-management') or directly under the parent data node
   (e.g., network).

   The administrative and operational state management profiled YANG
   data model shown in Figure 2 does not require the network to be a TE
   network and, therefore, it could be used as a core network topology
   model to manage the administrative and operational state for nodes,
   termination points and links as well as the administrative names for
   networks, nodes, termination points and links.

2.3.  Overlay and Underlay Topologies

   The navigation of the overlay/underlay relationship for nodes and
   links is independent from whether the overlay or underlay networks
   are TE or non-TE.

   The YANG data model defined in [RFC8795] supports the management of
   overlay/underlay relationship for nodes and links, as described in
   section 5.8 of [RFC8795].

   The following profile of the YANG data model defined in [RFC8795] can
   be used for to manage overlay/underlay network data:

      module: ietf-te-topology
        augment /nw:netorks/nw:network/nw:network-types:
          +--rw te-topology!
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node:
          +--rw te-node-id?   te-types:te-node-id
          +--rw te!
             +--rw te-node-attributes
                +--rw underlay-topology {te-topology-hierarchy}?
                   +--rw network-ref? -> /nw:networks/network/network-id
        augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link:
          +--rw te!
             +--rw te-link-attributes
                +--rw underlay {te-topology-hierarchy}?
                   +--rw enabled?                     boolean
                   +--rw primary-path
                      +--rw network-ref?
                      |       -> /nw:networks/network/network-id

                         +--rw path-element-id              uint32

Internet-Draft            TE Topology Profiles              October 2025


   Note: It would have been more straightforward to understand that the
   solution is generic if the 'underlay-topology' container or the
   'underlay' container were defined under a container with a different
   name than 'te' or directly under the parent 'node' or, respectively,
   'link' data node.

   The underlay/overlay network profiled YANG data model shown in
   Figure 3 does not require the network to be a TE network and,
   therefore, it could be used as a core network topology model to
   manage the overlay/underlay navigation between different network
   topologies.

   The advantages of using the underlay/overlay network profiled YANG
   data model shown in Figure 3 as a core network topology model is to
   have a common solutions for navigating between overlay/underlay
   network topologies where:

   *  both the underlay and overlay network topologies are TE networks;

   *  both the underlay and overlay network topologies are non-TE
      networks;

   *  the underlay and overlay network topologies are TE and non-TE
      networks;

   *  the underlay or the overlay network topology is a multi-layer
      network encompassing both TE and non-TE layers.

2.3.1.  Supporting relationships in RFC8345

   [RFC8345] defines the modeling constructs for supporting relations,
   including supporting network (i.e. topology), supporting node,
   supporting link, and supporting termination point.  These relation
   constructs facilitate network mappings and transformations.  One use
   case is to map a customized topology to a native topology.  The
   customized topology uses different name spaces from the native
   topology when naming nodes, links, or termination points.  There is a
   supporting relationship between a modeling construct in the
   customized topography to its counterpart in the native topology.  In
   such a relationship, the modeling constructs at both ends represent
   the same type of network objects, which can be network (i.e.
   topology), node, link, or termination point.

   [RFC8795] defines the modeling constructs for network overlay and
   underlay relations.  When the network overlay technology is used,
   some network objects (nodes or links) in the overlay network are
   built on top of network objects in the underlay network.  As a
   result, the overlay-underlay relationship is created between network

Internet-Draft            TE Topology Profiles              October 2025


   objects in the overlay networks and other network objects in the
   underlay network.  Between the network object pairs in the overlay-
   underlay relationship, the types of the network objects are usually
   not the same.  The network object can be a node in the overlay
   network, while the related underlay network object is a topology in
   the underlay network.  A link in the overlay network can be related
   to a path that consists of a sequence of nodes and links in the
   underlay network.

2.4.  Nodes with switching limitations

   It is worth noting that a node, as defined in [RFC8345], does not
   provide any information about the possible connectivity between its
   TPs.

   A node can have some switching limitations where connectivity is not
   possible between all its TP pairs, for example when:

   *  the node represents a physical device with switching limitations;

   *  the node represents an abstraction of a network topology.

   The management of nodes with switching limitations is independent
   from whether the network is TE or non-TE.

   The YANG data model defined in [RFC8795] supports the management of
   nodes with switching limitations by defining the node connectivity
   matrix to represent feasible connections between termination points
   across the nodes.

   The following profile of the YANG data model defined in [RFC8795] can
   be used for modelling nodes with connectivity constraints:

          Figure 4: Generic Topology with connectivity constraints

   Note: It would have been more straightforward to understand that the
   solution is generic if the 'connectivity-matrices' container were
   defined under a container with a different name than 'te' or directly
   under the parent 'node' data node.

   The node connectivity constraints profiled YANG data model shown in
   Figure 4 does not require the network to be a TE network and,
   therefore, it could be used as a core network topology model to
   manage nodes with certain connectivity constraints.

2.5.  Multipoint links

   The management of multipoint links is independent from whether the
   links are TE or non-TE.

   According to Section 4.4.4 of [RFC8345], multipoint links can be
   "represented through pseudonodes (similar to IS-IS, for example)".














Busi, et al.              Expires 20 April 2026                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft            TE Topology Profiles              October 2025


   Each access point can have different directionality with respect to
   the multipoint link, as shown in Figure 5: - an access point of a
   multipoint link can be able to both transmit and receive traffic:
   this access point can be modelled as a TP (e.g., TP A in Figure 5)
   terminating two links, one incoming link (e.g., Link 1 in Figure 5)
   and one outgoing link (e.g., Link 2 in Figure 5); - an access point
   of a multipoint link can be able only to receive traffic: this access
   point can be modelled as a TP (e.g., TP B in Figure 5) with only one
   incoming link (e.g., Link 3 in Figure 5); - an access point of a
   multipoint link can be able only to transmit traffic: this access
   point can be modelled as a TP (e.g., TP C in Figure 5) with only one
   outgoing link (e.g., Link 4 in Figure 5).

   See: Figure in
   https://github.com/tsaad-dev/te/pull/314#discussion_r2440659072

       Figure 5: Example of a pseudonode modelling a multipoint link

   The switching limitations of the pseudonode, as defined in
   Section 2.4, provides sufficient information to identify the type of
   multipoint link: - in case of multipoint links, the connectivity
   matrix of the pseudnode, reports that connectivity is enabled by
   default between all the TPs of the node; - in case of point-to-
   multipoint links, the connectivity matrix of the pseudnode, reports
   that connectivity is possible only between the root TP and the leaf
   TPs >> - if the point-to-multipoint link is bidirectional, the
   connectivity matrix of the pseudonodes reports that connectivity is
   possible from the root TP to the leaf TPs as well as from the leaf
   TPs to the root TP; >> - the connectivity matrix of the psuedonode
   can also describe point-to-multipoint links with more than one root
   (also known as rooted-multipoint links), indicating also whether
   connectivity between root TPs is allowed or not; - in case of hybrid
   multipoint links, as defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept], the
   connectivity matrix of the pseunode reports the list of TP pairs for
   which connectivity is allowed or not allowed.

   It is worth noting that the directionality of the access point of a
   multipoint link overrides the switching limitations of the
   pseudonode.  For example, even if the connectivity matrix of the
   psuedonode in Figure 5 indicates that connectivity is possible
   between TP A and TP B, the traffic entering the pseudonode from TP A
   cannot be transmitted by TP B since there is no outgoing link from TP
   B.

   Therefore, the connectivity matrix of a pseudonode modelling a point-
   to-multipoint unidirectional link, does not need to report that
   connectivity is only possible from the root TP to the leaf TPs but it
   can report that connectivity is possible by default between all the

Internet-Draft            TE Topology Profiles              October 2025


   TPs of the node.  The fact that the pseudonode is a point-to-
   multipoint unidirectional link can be understood by the fact that
   there is only one root TP, which can only receive traffic, and one or
   more leaf TPs, which can only transmit traffic.

3.  Technology-specific augmentations

   There are two main options to define technology-specific Topology
   Models which can use the attributes defined in the TE Topology Model
   [RFC8795].

   Both options are applicable to any possible profile of the TE
   Topology Model, such as those defined in Section 2.

   The first option is to define a technology-specific TE Topology Model
   which augments the TE Topology Model, as shown in Figure 6:

                              +-------------------+
                              | Network Topology  |
                              +-------------------+
                                        ^
                                        |
                                        | Augments
                                        |
                            +-----------+-----------+
                            |      TE Topology      |
                            |       (profile)       |
                            +-----------------------+
                                        ^
                                        |
                                        | Augments
                                        |
                             +----------+----------+
                             | Technology-Specific |
                             |     TE Topology     |
                             +---------------------+

                 Figure 6: Augmenting the TE Topology Model

   This approach is more suitable for cases when the technology-specific
   TE topology model provides augmentations to the TE Topology
   constructs, such as bandwidth information (e.g., link bandwidth),
   tunnel termination points (TTPs) or connectivity matrices.  It also
   allows providing augmentations to the Network Topology constructs,
   such as nodes, links, and termination points (TPs).






Busi, et al.              Expires 20 April 2026                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft            TE Topology Profiles              October 2025


   This is the approach currently used in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-eth-client-te-topo-yang] and
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang].

   It is worth noting that a profile of the technology-specific TE
   Topology model not using any TE topology attribute or constructs can
   be used to address any use case that do not require these attributes.
   In this case, only the 'te-topology' presence container of the TE
   Topology Model needs to be implemented because it is the parent
   container for the 'network-type' representing the technology-specific
   topology model.  Other data nodes defined in the TE Topology Model do
   not need to be implemented by this profile.

   The second option is to define a technology-specific Network Topology
   Model which augments the Network Topology Model and to rely on the
   multiple inheritance capability, which is implicit in the network-
   types definition of [RFC8345], to allow using also the generic
   attributes defined in the TE Topology model:

                       +-----------------------+
                       |    Network Topology   |
                       +-----------------------+
                           ^               ^
                           |               |
              Augments +---+               +--+ Augments
                       |                      |
             +---------+---+       +----------+----------+
             | TE Topology |       | Technology-specific |
             |  (profile)  |       |  Network Topology   |
             +-------------+       +---------------------+

        Figure 7: Augmenting the Network Topology Model with multi-
                                inheritance

   This approach is more suitable in cases where the technology-specific
   Network Topology Model provides augmentation only to the constructs
   defined in the Network Topology Model, such as nodes, links, and
   termination points (TPs).  Therefore, with this approach, only the
   generic attributes defined in the TE Topology Model could be used.

   It is also worth noting that in this case, technology-specific
   augmentations for the bandwidth information could not be defined.

   In principle, it would be also possible to define both a technology
   specific TE Topology Model which augments the TE Topology Model, and
   a technology-specific Network Topology Model which augments the
   Network Topology Model and to rely on the multiple inheritance
   capability, as shown in Figure 8:

        Figure 8: Augmenting both the Network and TE Topology Models

   This option does not provide any technical advantage with respect to
   the first option, shown in Figure 6, but could be useful to add
   augmentations to the TE Topology constructs and to re-use an already
   existing technology-specific Network Topology Model.

   It is worth noting that the technology-specific TE Topology model can
   reference constructs defined by the technology-specific Network
   Topology model but it could not augment constructs defined by the
   technology-specific Network Topology model.

3.1.  Multi-inheritance

   As described in section 4.1 of [RFC8345], the network types should be
   defined using presence containers to allow the representation of
   network subtypes.

   The hierarchy of network subtypes can be single hierarchy, as shown
   in Figure 6.  In this case, each presence container contains at most
   one child presence container, as shows in the JSON code below:

       "ietf-te-topology:te-topology": {
         "example-te-topology": {}
       }
     }
   }

   The hierarchy of network subtypes can also be multi-hierarchy, as
   shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8.  In this case, one presence container
   can contain more than one child presence containers, as show in the
   JSON codes below:

   {
     "ietf-network:ietf-network": {
       "ietf-te-topology:te-topology": {}
       "example-network-topology": {}

       "example-network-topology": {}
     }
   }

   Other examples of multi-hierarchy topologies are described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-sr-te-topo].

3.2.  Example (Link augmentation)

   This section provides an example on how technology-specific
   attributes can be added to the Link construct:

                              +--rw example?   example-bandwidth

     Figure 9: Augmenting the Link with technology-specific attributes

   The technology-specific attributes within the example-link-attributes
   container can be defined either in the technology-specific TE
   Topology Model (Option 1) or in the technology-specific Network
   Topology Model (Option 2 or Option 3).  These attributes can only be
   non-TE and do not require the implementation of the te container.

   The technology-specific attributes within the example-te-link-
   attributes container as well as the example max-link-bandwidth can
   only be defined in the technology-specific TE Topology Model (Option
   1 or Option 3).  These attributes can be TE or non-TE and require the
   implementation of the te container.

4.  Open Issues

4.1.  Implemented profiles

   When a server implements a profile of the TE topology model, there is
   no standardized mechanism for the server to report to the client the
   subset of the model being implemented.



Busi, et al.              Expires 20 April 2026                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft            TE Topology Profiles              October 2025


   This might not be an issue in case the TE topology profile is read by
   the the client because the server reports in the operational
   datastore only the leaves which have been implemented, as described
   in section 5.3 of [RFC8342].

   More investigation is instead required in case the TE topology
   profile is configured by the client, to avoid that the client tries
   to write an attribute not used in the TE Topology profile implemented
   by the server.

   It is also worth noting that the supported profile may also depend on
   other attributes (for example the network type), so the YANG
   deviation mechanism is not applicable to this scenario.

   Note: that this issue is also tracked in github as issue #161.

4.2.  Applicability to non-TE use cases

   Extending the applicability of RFC8795 to non-TE use cases is
   important.  However, it is desirable to avoid any debate about
   whether these use cases in section 2 are or are not TE.

   Note: that this issue is also tracked in github as issue #276.

4.2.1.  Update UNI topology discovery use case

   Section 2.1 points to individual drafts and does reflect the progress
   made since then.  For example, the UNI draft was replaced by other
   drafts that then led to the SAP model [RFC9408], which covers both
   UNI and NNI.

   Note: that this issue is also tracked in github as issue #275.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document provides only information about how the TE Topology
   Model, as defined in [RFC8795], can be profiled to address some
   scenarios which are not considered as TE.

   As such, this document does not introduce any additional security
   considerations besides those already defined in [RFC8795].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.
