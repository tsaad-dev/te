<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>Many network scenarios are being discussed in various IETF Working Groups (WGs) that are not classified as "Traffic Engineering" use cases but can be addressed by a profile (sub-set) of the Topology YANG data model, defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>.</t>

<t>Traffic Engineering (TE) is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-rfc3272bis"/> as aspects of
Internet network engineering that deal with the issues of performance
evaluation and performance optimization of operational IP networks.
TE encompasses the application of technology and scientific
principles to the measurement, characterization, modeling, and
control of Internet traffic.</t>

<t>The Topology YANG data model, defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>, augments the Network Topology YANG data model, defined in <xref target="RFC8345"/>, with generic and technology-agnostic features that are not only applicable to TE-centric deployments, but also applicable to non-TE-centric yet TE-aware deployments.</t>

<t>A TE-aware deployment is one where the topology carries information that can be used to influence how traffic can be engineered within the network. In some scenarios, this information can be leveraged even in use cases where traffic doesn't need to be engineered.</t>

<t>Examples of generic TE-aware features that can apply to both TE-centric and non-TE-centric use-cases are: inter-domain link discovery (plug-id), geo-localization, multi-layer topology representation, node-specific switching limitation, link reliability, and topology abstraction.</t>

<t>It is also worth noting that also the boundary between the TE-specific model constructs and the core network topology model constructs is also blurred since new applications may need to leverage on constructs which was originally defined to support TE-centric scenarios but that are also needed to support these new applications.</t>

<t>An example of a concept that originated from TE-centric scenarios but can be considered a core network topology model construct is the SRLG. New applications such as what-if analysis need to be aware of the SRLG information also for non-TE-centric scenarios to provide reliable results.</t>

<t>It is also worth noting that the Topology YANG data model, defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>, is quite an
extensive and comprehensive model in which most features are
optional. Therefore, even though the full model appears to be complex, at the first glance, a profile (sub-set) of the model can be used to address specific scenarios irrespective of whether they are TE-centric or not.</t>

<t>The implementation of profiles can simplify and expedite adoption of the Topology YANG data model, defined <xref target="RFC8795"/>, and allow for its reuse even for non-TE-centric use-cases. The key question is whether all or some of the attributes defined in the Topology YANG data model, defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>, are needed to address a given network scenario.</t>

<t><xref target="examples"/> provides examples where profiles of the Topology YANG data model, defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>, can be used to address some generic use cases applicable to both TE-centric and non-TE-centric deployments.</t>

<t>Understanding that these profiles are generic would be more straightforward
if the profiled YANG data nodes where defined
under a container with a different name than 'te' or directly under the parent YANG data node.
However, the 'te' container in the context of <xref target="RFC8795"/>, should be understood as the container of YANG data nodes providing TE-aware topology information.</t>

<section anchor="uni-discovery"><name>UNI Topology Discovery</name>

<t>The following profile of the Topology YANG data model, defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>, can be used to support the UNI Topology Discovery, or in general, inter-domain link discovery:</t>

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>It is also worth noting that the UNI links can also be TE (e.g. an OTN UNI) or non-TE (e.g., an Ethernet UNI) as well as multi-function UNI links, supporting both TE and non-TE technologies, such as the UNI links, described in <xref section="4.4" sectionFormat="of" target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-transport-nbi-app-statement"/>, which can be configured either OTN UNI or Ethernet UNI or SDH UNI.</t>

<t>The UNI Topology profiled YANG data model shown in <xref target="uni-discovery-tree"/> can also be used with technology-specific UNI augmentations, as described in <xref target="augmentations"/>. Technology-specific augmentations can for example describe the capability of the TP to be configured as a UNI for the types of services supported by the UNI (e.g., L2VPN/L3VPN).</t>

<t>For example, in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-eth-client-te-topo-yang"/>,
the eth-svc container is defined to
represent the capabilities of the Termination Point (TP) to be
configured as an Ethernet UNI, together with the Ethernet
classification and VLAN operations supported by that TP.</t>

<t>The <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang"/> provides another example, where:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>the client-svc container is defined to represent the capabilities
of the TP to be configured as an transparent client UNI (e.g.,
STM-N, Fiber Channel or transparent Ethernet);</t>
  <t>the OTN technology-specific Link Termination Point (LTP)
augmentations are defined to represent the capabilities of the TP
to be configured as an OTN UNI, together with the information
about OTN label and bandwidth availability at the OTN UNI.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Te UNI Topology profiled YANG data model shown in <xref target="uni-discovery-tree"/> does not require the network to be a TE network and, therefore, it could be used as a core network topology model to discover UNIs (or in general any external link) for TE and non-TE networks as well as multi-layer networks encompassing both TE and non-TE layers.</t>

<t>The advantages of using the UNI Topology profiled YANG data model shown in <xref target="uni-discovery-tree"/>
as a core network topology model is to have a common solutions for:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>discovering UNIs as well as inter-domain NNI links, which is
applicable to any technology (TE or non TE) used at the UNI or
within the network;</t>
  <t>modelling non TE UNIs such as Ethernet, and TE UNIs such as OTN,
as well as UNIs which can configured as TE or non-TE (e.g., being
configured as either Ethernet or OTN UNI).</t>

</list></t>

<section anchor="supporting-relationships-in-rfc8345"><name>Supporting relationships in RFC8345</name>

<t><xref target="RFC8345"/> defines the modeling constructs for supporting relations, including supporting network (i.e. topology), supporting node, supporting link, and supporting termination point. These relation constructs facilitate network mappings and transformations. One use case is to map a customized topology to a native topology. The customized topology uses different name spaces from the native topology when naming nodes, links, or termination points. There is a supporting relationship between a modeling construct in the customized topography to its counterpart in the native topology. In such a relationship, the modeling constructs at both ends represent the same type of network objects, which can be network (i.e. topology), node, link, or termination point.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC8795"/> defines the modeling constructs for network overlay and underlay relations. When the network overlay technology is used, some network objects (nodes or links) in the overlay network are built on top of network objects in the underlay network. As a result, the overlay-underlay relationship is created between network objects in the overlay networks and other network objects in the underlay network. Between the network object pairs in the overlay-underlay relationship, the types of the network objects are usually not the same. The network object can be a node in the overlay network, while the related underlay network object is a topology in the underlay network. A link in the overlay network can be related to a path that consists of a sequence of nodes and links in the underlay network.</t>

<section anchor="mp-links"><name>Multipoint links</name>

<t>According to <xref section="4.4.4" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC8345"/>, multipoint links can be "represented through pseudonodes (similar to IS-IS, for example)".</t>

<t>Each access point can have different directionality with respect to the multipoint link, as shown in <xref target="mp-link-example"/>:
- an access point of a multipoint link can be able to both transmit and receive traffic: this access point can be modelled as a TP (e.g., TP A in <xref target="mp-link-example"/>) terminating two links, one incoming link (e.g., Link 1 in <xref target="mp-link-example"/>) and one outgoing link (e.g., Link 2 in <xref target="mp-link-example"/>);
- an access point of a multipoint link can be able only to receive traffic: this access point can be modelled as a TP (e.g., TP B in <xref target="mp-link-example"/>) with only one incoming link (e.g., Link 3 in <xref target="mp-link-example"/>);
- an access point of a multipoint link can be able only to transmit traffic: this access point can be modelled as a TP (e.g., TP C in <xref target="mp-link-example"/>) with only one outgoing link (e.g., Link 4 in <xref target="mp-link-example"/>).</t>

<t>The switching limitations of the pseudonode, as defined in <xref target="switching-limitations"/>, provides sufficient information to identify the type of multipoint link:
- in case of multipoint links, the connectivity matrix of the pseudnode, reports that connectivity is enabled by default between all the TPs of the node;
- in case of point-to-multipoint links, the connectivity matrix of the pseudnode, reports that connectivity is possible only between the root TP and the leaf TPs
&gt;&gt;
- if the point-to-multipoint link is bidirectional, the connectivity matrix of the pseudonodes reports that connectivity is possible from the root TP to the leaf TPs as well as from the leaf TPs to the root TP;
&gt;&gt;
- the connectivity matrix of the psuedonode can also describe point-to-multipoint links with more than one root (also known as rooted-multipoint links), indicating also whether connectivity between root TPs is allowed or not;
- in case of hybrid multipoint links, as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept"/>, the connectivity matrix of the pseunode reports the list of TP pairs for which connectivity is allowed or not allowed.</t>

<t>It is worth noting that the directionality of the access point of a multipoint link overrides the switching limitations of the pseudonode. For example, even if the connectivity matrix of the psuedonode in <xref target="mp-link-example"/> indicates that connectivity is possible between TP A and TP B, the traffic entering the pseudonode from TP A cannot be transmitted by TP B since there is no outgoing link from TP B.</t>

<t>Therefore, the connectivity matrix of a pseudonode modelling a point-to-multipoint unidirectional link, does not need to report that connectivity is only possible from the root TP to the leaf TPs but it can report that connectivity is possible by default between all the TPs of the node.
The pseudonode represents a point-to-multipoint unidirectional link, as indicated by a single root TP that can only receive traffic and one or more leaf TPs that can only transmit traffic.</t>

<t>There are two main options to define technology-specific Topology
   Models which can use the attributes defined in the
   Topology YANG data model, defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>.</t>

<t>Both options are applicable to any possible profile of the TE
   Topology Model, such as those defined in <xref target="examples"/>.</t>

<t>The first option is to define a technology-specific TE Topology Model
   which augments the TE Topology Model, as shown in <xref target="te-augment-fig"/>:</t>

<t>This approach is more suitable for cases when the technology-specific
TE topology model provides augmentations to the TE Topology
constructs, such as bandwidth information (e.g., link bandwidth),
tunnel termination points (TTPs) or connectivity matrices. It also
allows providing augmentations to the Network Topology constructs,
such as nodes, links, and termination points (TPs).</t>

<t>This is the approach currently used in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-eth-client-te-topo-yang"/>
and <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang"/>.</t>

<t>It is worth noting that a profile of the technology-specific TE
Topology model not using any TE topology attribute or constructs can
be used to address any use case that do not require these attributes.
In this case, only the 'te-topology' presence container of the TE
Topology Model needs to be implemented because it is the parent container
for the 'network-type' representing the technology-specific topology model.
Other data nodes defined in the TE Topology Model do not need to be implemented by this profile.</t>

<t>The second option is to define a technology-specific Network Topology
Model which augments the Network Topology Model and to rely on the
multiple inheritance capability, which is implicit in the network-
types definition of <xref target="RFC8345"/>, to allow using also the generic
attributes defined in the TE Topology model:</t>

          +-------------+       +---------------------+
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This approach is more suitable in cases where the technology-specific
Network Topology Model provides augmentation only to the constructs
defined in the Network Topology Model, such as nodes, links, and
termination points (TPs). Therefore, with this approach, only the
generic attributes defined in the TE Topology Model could be used.</t>

<t>It is also worth noting that in this case, technology-specific
augmentations for the bandwidth information could not be defined.</t>

<t>In principle, it would be also possible to define both a technology
specific TE Topology Model which augments the TE Topology Model, and
a technology-specific Network Topology Model which augments the
Network Topology Model and to rely on the multiple inheritance
capability, as shown in <xref target="double-augment-fig"/>:</t>

<t>This option does not provide any technical advantage with respect to
the first option, shown in <xref target="te-augment-fig"/>, but could be useful to add
augmentations to the TE Topology constructs and to re-use an already
existing technology-specific Network Topology Model.</t>

<t>It is worth noting that the technology-specific TE Topology model can
reference constructs defined by the technology-specific Network
Topology model but it could not augment constructs defined by the
technology-specific Network Topology model.</t>

<section anchor="multi-inheritance"><name>Multi-inheritance</name>

<t>As described in section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC8345"/>, the network types should be defined
using presence containers to allow the representation of network subtypes.</t>

<t>The hierarchy of network subtypes can be single hierarchy, as shown in <xref target="te-augment-fig"/>.
In this case, each presence container contains at most one child presence container,
as shows in the JSON code below:</t>

<t>The hierarchy of network subtypes can also be multi-hierarchy, as shown in <xref target="multi-inheritance-fig"/> and <xref target="double-augment-fig"/>.
In this case, one presence container can contain more than one child presence containers, as show in the JSON codes below:</t>

<t>The technology-specific attributes within the example-link-attributes
container can be defined either in the technology-specific TE
Topology Model (Option 1) or in the technology-specific Network
Topology Model (Option 2 or Option 3). These attributes can only be
non-TE and do not require the implementation of the te container.</t>

<t>The technology-specific attributes within the
example-te-link-attributes container as well as the example
max-link-bandwidth can only be defined in the technology-specific TE

non-TE and require the implementation of the te container.</t>

<section anchor="open-issues"><name>Open Issues</name>

<section anchor="implement"><name>Implemented profiles</name>

<t>When a server implements a profile of the TE topology model, there is no standardized mechanism for the server to report to the client the subset of the model being implemented.</t>

<t>This might not be an issue in case the TE topology profile is read by the the client because the server reports in the operational datastore only the leaves which have been implemented, as described
in section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>

<t>More investigation is instead required in case the TE topology profile is configured by the client, to  avoid that the client tries to write an attribute not used in the TE Topology profile implemented by the server.</t>

<t>It is also worth noting that the supported profile may also depend on other attributes
(for example the network type), so the YANG deviation mechanism is not applicable to this scenario.</t>

<t>Note: that this issue is also tracked in github as issue #161.</t>

	 <t>   This document describes the principles of traffic engineering (TE) in
   the Internet.  The document is intended to promote better
   understanding of the issues surrounding traffic engineering in IP
   networks and the networks that support IP networking, and to provide
   a common basis for the development of traffic engineering
   capabilities for the Internet.  The principles, architectures, and
   methodologies for performance evaluation and performance optimization
   of operational networks are also discussed.

   This work was first published as RFC 3272 in May 2002.  This document
   obsoletes RFC 3272 by making a complete update to bring the text in
   line with best current practices for Internet traffic engineering and
   to include references to the latest relevant work in the IETF.
