<t>This document describes how profiles of the Traffic Engineering (TE)
   Topology Model, defined in RFC8795, can be used to address
   applications beyond "Traffic Engineering".</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>There are many network scenarios being discussed in various IETF
   Working Groups (WGs) that are not classified as "Traffic Engineering"
   but can be addressed by a sub-set (profile) of the Traffic
   Engineering (TE) Topology YANG data model, defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>.</t>

<t>Traffic Engineering (TE) is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-rfc3272bis"/> as aspects of
   Internet network engineering that deal with the issues of performance
   evaluation and performance optimization of operational IP networks.
   TE encompasses the application of technology and scientific
   principles to the measurement, characterization, modeling, and
   control of Internet traffic.</t>

<t>The TE Topology Model is augmenting the Network Topology Model
   defined in <xref target="RFC8345"/> with generic and technology-agnostic features
   that some are strictly applicable to TE networks, while others
   applicable to both TE and non-TE networks.</t>

<t>Examples of such features that are applicable to both TE and non-TE
   networks are: inter-domain link discovery (plug-id), geo-
   localization, and admin/operational status.</t>

<t>It is also worth noting that the TE Topology Model is quite an
   extensive and comprehensive model in which most features are
   optional. Therefore, even though the full model appears to be
   complex, at the first glance, a sub-set of the model (profile) can be
   used to address specific scenarios, e.g. suitable also to non-TE use
   cases.</t>

<t>The implementation of such TE Topology profiles can simplify and
   expedite adoption of the full TE topology YANG data model, and allow
   for its reuse even for non-TE use case. The key question being
   whether all or some of the attributes defined in the TE Topology
   Model are needed to address a given network scenario.</t>

<t><xref target="examples"/> provides examples where profiles of the TE Topology Model
   can be used to address some generic use cases applicable to both TE
   and non-TE technologies.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="examples"><name>Examples of non-TE scenarios</name>

<section anchor="uni-discovery"><name>UNI Topology Discovery</name>

<t>UNI Topology Discovery is independent from whether the network is TE
   or non-TE.</t>

<t>The TE Topology Model supports inter-domain link discovery (including
   but not being limited to UNI link discovery) using the plug-id
   attribute. This solution is quite generic and does not require the
   network to be a TE network.</t>

<t>The following profile of the TE Topology model can be used for the
   UNI Topology Discovery:</t>

          +--ro oper-status?                   te-types:te-oper-status
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The profile data model shown in <xref target="uni-discovery-tree"/> can be used to discover TE
   and non TE UNIs as well as to discover UNIs for TE or non TE
   networks.</t>

<t>Such a UNI TE Topology profile model can also be used with
   technology-specific UNI augmentations, as described in section 3.</t>

<t>For example, in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-eth-client-te-topo-yang"/>,
   the eth-svc container is defined to
   represent the capabilities of the Termination Point (TP) to be
   configured as an Ethernet client UNI, together with the Ethernet
   classification and VLAN operations supported by that TP.</t>

<t>The <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang"/> provides another example, where:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>the client-svc container is defined to represent the capabilities
of the TP to be configured as an transparent client UNI (e.g.,
STM-N, Fiber Channel or transparent Ethernet);</t>
  <t>the OTN technology-specific Link Termination Point (LTP)
augmentations are defined to represent the capabilities of the TP
to be configured as an OTN UNI, together with the information
about OTN label and bandwidth availability at the OTN UNI.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
For example, the UNI TE Topology profile can be used to model
features defined in <xref target="I-D.ogondio-opsawg-uni-topology"/>:</t>
  <t>The inter-domain-plug-id attribute would provide the same
information as the attachment-id attribute defined in
<xref target="I-D.ogondio-opsawg-uni-topology"/>;</t>
  <t>The admin-status and oper-status that exists in this TE topology
profile can provide the same information as the admin-status and
oper-status attributes defined in <xref target="I-D.ogondio-opsawg-uni-topology"/>.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Following the same approach in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-eth-client-te-topo-yang"/>
and <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang"/>, the type
and encapsulation-type attributes can be defined by technology-
specific UNI augmentations to represent the capability of a TP to be
configured as a L2VPN/L3VPN UNI Service Attachment Point (SAP).  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
The advantages of using a TE Topology profile would be having common
solutions for:</t>
  <t>discovering UNIs as well as inter-domain NNI links, which is
applicable to any technology (TE or non TE) used at the UNI or
within the network;</t>
  <t>modelling non TE UNIs such as Ethernet, and TE UNIs such as OTN,
as well as UNIs which can configured as TE or non-TE (e.g., being
configured as either Ethernet or OTN UNI).</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="admin-oper-state"><name>Administrative and Operational status management</name>

<t>The TE Topology Model supports the management of administrative and
   operational state, including also the possibility to associate some
   administrative names, for nodes, termination points and links. This
   solution is generic and also does not require the network to be a TE
   network.</t>

   administrative and operational state management:</t>

<t>This approach is more suitable for cases when the technology-specific
   TE topology model provides augmentations to the TE Topology
   constructs, such as bandwidth information (e.g., link bandwidth),
   tunnel termination points (TTPs) or connectivity matrices. It also
   allows providing augmentations to the Network Topology constructs,
   such as nodes, links, and termination points (TPs).</t>

<t>This is the approach currently used in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-eth-client-te-topo-yang"/>
   and <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang"/>.</t>

<t>It is worth noting that a profile of the technology-specific TE
   Topology model not using any TE topology attribute or constructs can
   be used to address any use case that do not require these attributes.
   In this case, only the te-topology presence container of the TE
   Topology Model needs to be implemented.</t>

<t>The second option is to define a technology-specific Network Topology
   Model which augments the Network Topology Model and to rely on the
   multiple inheritance capability, which is implicit in the network-
   types definition of <xref target="RFC8345"/>, to allow using also the generic
   attributes defined in the TE Topology model:</t>

<t>This approach is more suitable in cases where the technology-specific
   Network Topology Model provides augmentation only to the constructs
   defined in the Network Topology Model, such as nodes, links, and
   termination points (TPs). Therefore, with this approach, only the
   generic attributes defined in the TE Topology Model could be used.</t>

<t>It is also worth noting that in this case, technology-specific
   augmentations for the bandwidth information could not be defined.</t>

<t>In principle, it would be also possible to define both a technology
   specific TE Topology Model which augments the TE Topology Model, and
   a technology-specific Network Topology Model which augments the
   Network Topology Model and to rely on the multiple inheritance
   capability, as shown in <xref target="double-augment-fig"/>:</t>

<t>This option does not provide any technical advantage with respect to

<t>As described in section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC8345"/>, the network types should be defined
using presence containers to allow the representation of network subtypes.</t>

In this case, each presence container contains at most one child presence container,
as shows in the JSON code below:</t>

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document describes the principles of traffic engineering (TE) in
   the Internet.  The document is intended to promote better
   understanding of the issues surrounding traffic engineering in IP
   networks and the networks that support IP networking, and to provide
   a common basis for the development of traffic engineering
   capabilities for the Internet.  The principles, architectures, and
   methodologies for performance evaluation and performance optimization
   of operational networks are also discussed.

   This work was first published as RFC 3272 in May 2002.  This document
   obsoletes RFC 3272 by making a complete update to bring the text in
   line with best current practices for Internet traffic engineering and
   to include references to the latest relevant work in the IETF.
