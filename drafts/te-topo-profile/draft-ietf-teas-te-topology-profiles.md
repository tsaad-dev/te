--- abstract

   This document describes how profiles of the Traffic Engineering (TE)
   Topology Model, defined in RFC8795, can be used to address
   applications beyond "Traffic Engineering".

--- middle

# Introduction {#introduction}

There are many network scenarios being discussed in various IETF
Working Groups (WGs) that are not classified as "Traffic Engineering"
but can be addressed by a sub-set (profile) of the YANG data model, defined in {{!RFC8795}}.

Traffic Engineering (TE) is defined in {{?I-D.ietf-teas-rfc3272bis}} as aspects of
Internet network engineering that deal with the issues of performance
evaluation and performance optimization of operational IP networks.
TE encompasses the application of technology and scientific
principles to the measurement, characterization, modeling, and
control of Internet traffic.

The TE Topology Model is augmenting the Network Topology Model
defined in {{!RFC8345}} with generic and technology-agnostic features
that some are strictly applicable to TE networks, while others
applicable to both TE and non-TE networks.

Examples of such features that are applicable to both TE and non-TE
networks are: inter-domain link discovery (plug-id), geo-
localization, and admin/operational status.

It is also worth noting that the TE Topology Model is quite an
extensive and comprehensive model in which most features are
optional. Therefore, even though the full model appears to be
complex, at the first glance, a sub-set of the model (profile) can be
used to address specific scenarios, e.g. suitable also to non-TE use
cases.

The implementation of such TE Topology profiles can simplify and
expedite adoption of the full TE topology YANG data model, and allow
for its reuse even for non-TE use case. The key question being
whether all or some of the attributes defined in the TE Topology
Model are needed to address a given network scenario.

{{examples}} provides examples where profiles of the TE Topology Model
can be used to address some generic use cases applicable to both TE
and non-TE technologies.

# Examples of non-TE scenarios {#examples}

## UNI Topology Discovery {#uni-discovery}

   UNI Topology Discovery is independent from whether the network is TE
   or non-TE.

   The TE Topology Model supports inter-domain link discovery (including
   but not being limited to UNI link discovery) using the plug-id
   attribute. This solution is quite generic and does not require the
   network to be a TE network.

   The following profile of the TE Topology model can be used for the
   UNI Topology Discovery:

~~~~ ascii-art
   module: ietf-te-topology
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types:
       +--rw te-topology!
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point:
       +--rw te-tp-id?   te-types:te-tp-id
       +--rw te!
          +--rw admin-status?
          |       te-types:te-admin-status
          +--rw inter-domain-plug-id?        binary
          +--ro oper-status?                 te-types:te-oper-status
~~~~
{: #uni-discovery-tree title="UNI Topology"}

   The profile data model shown in {{uni-discovery-tree}} can be used to discover TE
   and non TE UNIs as well as to discover UNIs for TE or non TE
   networks.

   Such a UNI TE Topology profile model can also be used with
   technology-specific UNI augmentations, as described in section 3.

   For example, in {{?I-D.ietf-ccamp-eth-client-te-topo-yang}},
   the eth-svc container is defined to
   represent the capabilities of the Termination Point (TP) to be
   configured as an Ethernet client UNI, together with the Ethernet
   classification and VLAN operations supported by that TP.

   The {{?I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang}} provides another example, where:

-  the client-svc container is defined to represent the capabilities
   of the TP to be configured as an transparent client UNI (e.g.,
   STM-N, Fiber Channel or transparent Ethernet);

-  the OTN technology-specific Link Termination Point (LTP)
   augmentations are defined to represent the capabilities of the TP
   to be configured as an OTN UNI, together with the information
   about OTN label and bandwidth availability at the OTN UNI.

   For example, the UNI TE Topology profile can be used to model
   features defined in {{?I-D.ogondio-opsawg-uni-topology}}:

-  The inter-domain-plug-id attribute would provide the same
   information as the attachment-id attribute defined in
   {{?I-D.ogondio-opsawg-uni-topology}};

-  The admin-status and oper-status that exists in this TE topology
   profile can provide the same information as the admin-status and
   oper-status attributes defined in {{?I-D.ogondio-opsawg-uni-topology}}.

   Following the same approach in {{?I-D.ietf-ccamp-eth-client-te-topo-yang}}
   and {{?I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang}}, the type
   and encapsulation-type attributes can be defined by technology-
   specific UNI augmentations to represent the capability of a TP to be
   configured as a L2VPN/L3VPN UNI Service Attachment Point (SAP).

   The advantages of using a TE Topology profile would be having common
   solutions for:

-  discovering UNIs as well as inter-domain NNI links, which is
   applicable to any technology (TE or non TE) used at the UNI or
   within the network;

-  modelling non TE UNIs such as Ethernet, and TE UNIs such as OTN,
   as well as UNIs which can configured as TE or non-TE (e.g., being
   configured as either Ethernet or OTN UNI).

## Administrative and Operational status management {#admin-oper-state}

The TE Topology Model supports the management of administrative and
operational state, including also the possibility to associate some
administrative names, for nodes, termination points and links. This
solution is generic and also does not require the network to be a TE
network.

The following profile of the TE Topology Model can be used for
administrative and operational state management:

~~~~

          +--rw name?                     string
          +--ro oper-status?              te-types:te-oper-status
~~~~
{:#admin-oper-state-tree title="Generic Topology with admin and operational state"}

The TE topology data model profile shown in {{admin-oper-state-tree}} is applicable to
any technology (TE or non-TE) that requires management of the
administrative and operational state and administrative names for
nodes, termination points and links.

## Overlay and Underlay non-TE Topologies {#overlay-underlay}

   The TE Topology model supports the management of overlay/underlay
   relationship for nodes and links, as described in section 5.8 of
   {{!RFC8795}}. This solution is generic and does not require the network
   to be a TE network.

   The following TE topology data model profile can be used to manage
   overlay/underlay network data:

~~~~
   module: ietf-te-topology
     augment /nw:netorks/nw:network/nw:network-types:
       +--rw te-topology!
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node:
       +--rw te-node-id?   te-types:te-node-id
       +--rw te!
          +--rw te-node-attributes
             +--rw underlay-topology {te-topology-hierarchy}?
                +--rw network-ref? -> /nw:networks/network/network-id
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link:
       +--rw te!
          +--rw te-link-attributes
             +--rw underlay {te-topology-hierarchy}?
                +--rw enabled?                     boolean
                +--rw primary-path
                   +--rw network-ref?
                   |       -> /nw:networks/network/network-id
                   +--rw path-element* [path-element-id]
                      +--rw path-element-id              uint32
                      +--rw (type)?
                         +--:(numbered-link-hop)
                         |  +--rw numbered-link-hop
                         |     +--rw link-tp-id    te-tp-id
                         |     +--rw hop-type?     te-hop-type
                         |     +--rw direction?    te-link-direction
                         +--:(unnumbered-link-hop)
                            +--rw unnumbered-link-hop
                               +--rw link-tp-id    te-tp-id
                               +--rw node-id       te-node-id
                               +--rw hop-type?     te-hop-type
                               +--rw direction?    te-link-direction
~~~~
{: #overlay-underlay-tree title="Generic Topology with overlay/underlay information"}

   This profile is applicable to any technology (TE or non-TE) when it
   is needed to manage the overlay/underlay information. It is also
   allows a TE underlay network to support a non-TE overlay network and,
   vice versa, a non-TE underlay network to support a TE overlay
   network.

## Nodes with switching limitations {#switching-limitations}

A node can have some switching limitations where connectivity is not
possible between all its TP pairs, for example when:

-  the node represents a physical device with switching limitations;

-  the node represents an abstraction of a network topology.

This scenario is generic and applies to both TE and non-TE
technologies.

A connectivity TE Topology profile data model supports the management
of the node connectivity matrix to represent feasible connections
between termination points across the nodes. This solution is generic
and does not necessarily require a TE enabled network.

The following profile of the TE Topology model can be used for nodes
with connectivity constraints:

~~~~
   module: ietf-te-topology
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types:
       +--rw te-topology!
     augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node:
       +--rw te-node-id?   te-types:te-node-id
       +--rw te!
          +--rw te-node-attributes
             +--rw connectivity-matrices
                +--rw number-of-entries?     uint16
                +--rw is-allowed?            boolean
                +--rw connectivity-matrix* [id]
                   +--rw id                  uint32
                   +--rw from
                   |  +--rw tp-ref?               leafref
                   +--rw to
                   |  +--rw tp-ref?               leafref
                   +--rw is-allowed?              boolean
~~~~
{:#switching-limitations-tree title="Generic Topology with connectivity constraints"}

The TE topology data model profile shown in {{switching-limitations-tree}}
is applicable to
any technology (TE or non-TE) networks that requires managing nodes
with certain connectivity constraints. When used with TE
technologies, additional TE attributes, as defined in {{!RFC8795}}, can
also be provided.

# Technology-specific augmentations {#augmentations}

   There are two main options to define technology-specific Topology
   Models which can use the attributes defined in the TE Topology Model
   {{!RFC8795}}.

   Both options are applicable to any possible profile of the TE
   Topology Model, such as those defined in {{examples}}.

   The first option is to define a technology-specific TE Topology Model
   which augments the TE Topology Model, as shown in {{te-augment-fig}}:

~~~~
                           +-------------------+
                           | Network Topology  |
                           +-------------------+
                                     ^

                                     | Augments
                                     |
                         +-----------+-----------+
                         |      TE Topology      |

                         +-----------------------+
                                     ^
                                     |
                                     | Augments
                                     |
                          +----------+----------+
                          | Technology-Specific |
                          |     TE Topology     |
                          +---------------------+
~~~~
{:#te-augment-fig title="Augmenting the TE Topology Model"}

This approach is more suitable for cases when the technology-specific
TE topology model provides augmentations to the TE Topology
constructs, such as bandwidth information (e.g., link bandwidth),
tunnel termination points (TTPs) or connectivity matrices. It also
allows providing augmentations to the Network Topology constructs,
such as nodes, links, and termination points (TPs).

This is the approach currently used in {{?I-D.ietf-ccamp-eth-client-te-topo-yang}}
and {{?I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang}}.

It is worth noting that a profile of the technology-specific TE
Topology model not using any TE topology attribute or constructs can
be used to address any use case that do not require these attributes.
In this case, only the te-topology presence container of the TE
Topology Model needs to be implemented.

The second option is to define a technology-specific Network Topology
Model which augments the Network Topology Model and to rely on the
multiple inheritance capability, which is implicit in the network-
types definition of {{!RFC8345}}, to allow using also the generic
attributes defined in the TE Topology model:

~~~~
                    +-----------------------+
                    |    Network Topology   |
                    +-----------------------+
                        ^               ^
                        |               |
           Augments +---+               +--+ Augments

          +---------+---+       +----------+----------+
          | TE Topology |       | Technology-specific |
          |  (profile)  |       |  Network Topology   |
          +-------------+       +---------------------+
~~~~
{:#multi-inheritance-fig title="Augmenting the Network Topology Model with multi-inheritance"}

This approach is more suitable in cases where the technology-specific
Network Topology Model provides augmentation only to the constructs
defined in the Network Topology Model, such as nodes, links, and
termination points (TPs). Therefore, with this approach, only the
generic attributes defined in the TE Topology Model could be used.

It is also worth noting that in this case, technology-specific
augmentations for the bandwidth information could not be defined.

In principle, it would be also possible to define both a technology
specific TE Topology Model which augments the TE Topology Model, and
a technology-specific Network Topology Model which augments the
Network Topology Model and to rely on the multiple inheritance
capability, as shown in {{double-augment-fig}}:

~~~~
                    +-----------------------+
                    |    Network Topology   |

{:#double-augment-fig title="Augmenting both the Network and TE Topology Models"}

This option does not provide any technical advantage with respect to
the first option, shown in {{te-augment-fig}}, but could be useful to add
augmentations to the TE Topology constructs and to re-use an already
existing technology-specific Network Topology Model.

It is worth noting that the technology-specific TE Topology model can
reference constructs defined by the technology-specific Network
Topology model but it could not augment constructs defined by the
technology-specific Network Topology model.

## Multi-inheritance {#multi-inheritance}

As described in section 4.1 of {{RFC8345}}, the network types should be defined
using presence containers to allow the representation of network subtypes.

The hierarchy of network subtypes can be single hierarchy, as shown in {{te-augment-fig}}.
In this case, each presence container contains at most one child presence container,
as shows in the JSON code below:

~~~~
{
  "ietf-network:ietf-network": {
    "ietf-te-topology:te-topology": {
      "example-te-topology": {}
    }
  }
}
~~~~

The hierarchy of network subtypes can also be multi-hierarchy, as shown in {{multi-inheritance-fig}} and {{double-augment-fig}}.
In this case, one presence container can contain more than one child presence containers, as show in the JSON codes below:

~~~~
{
  "ietf-network:ietf-network": {
    "ietf-te-topology:te-topology": {}
    "example-network-topology": {}
  }
}
~~~~

~~~~
{
  "ietf-network:ietf-network": {
    "ietf-te-topology:te-topology": {
      "example-te-topology": {}
    }
    "example-network-topology": {}
  }
}
~~~~

Other examples of multi-hierarchy topologies are described in
{{?I-D.ietf-teas-yang-sr-te-topo}}.

## Example (Link augmentation) {#example-link}

This section provides an example on how technology-specific
attributes can be added to the Link construct:

~~~~
      +--rw link* [link-id]
         +--rw link-id            link-id
         +--rw source
         |  +--rw source-node?   -> ../../../nw:node/node-id
         |  +--rw source-tp?     leafref
         +--rw destination

{:#example-link-tree title="Augmenting the Link with technology-specific attributes"}

The technology-specific attributes within the example-link-attributes
container can be defined either in the technology-specific TE
Topology Model (Option 1) or in the technology-specific Network
Topology Model (Option 2 or Option 3). These attributes can only be
non-TE and do not require the implementation of the te container.

The technology-specific attributes within the
example-te-link-attributes container as well as the example
max-link-bandwidth can only be defined in the technology-specific TE
Topology Model (Option 1 or Option 3). These attributes can be TE or
non-TE and require the implementation of the te container.

# Open Issues {#open-issues}

## Supporting node/link versus overlay/underlay

Some more explanation of the difference between supporting-node/supporting-link and overlay/underlay has been requested.

Note: that this issue is also tracked in github as issue #167.

## Implemented profiles {#implement}

When a server implements a profile of the TE topology model, there is no standardized mechanism for the server to report to the client the subset of the model being implemented.

This might not be an issue in case the TE topology profile is read by the the client because the server reports in the operational datastore only the leaves which have been implemented, as described
in section 5.3 of {{!RFC8342}}.

More investigation is instead required in case the TE topology profile is configured by the client, to  avoid that the client tries to write an attribute not used in the TE Topology profile implemented by the server.

It is also worth noting that the supported profile may also depend on other attributes
(for example the network type), so the YANG deviation mechanism is not applicable to this scenario.

Note: that this issue is also tracked in github as issue #161.

## Applicability to non-TE use cases

Extending the applicability of RFC8795 to non-TE use cases is important. However, it is desirable to avoid any debate about whether these use cases in section 2 are or are not TE.

Note: that this issue is also tracked in github as issue #276.

### Update UNI topology discovery use case

{{uni-discovery}} points to individual drafts and does reflect the progress made since then. For example, the UNI draft was replaced by other drafts that then led to the SAP model {{?RFC9408}}, which covers both UNI and NNI.

Note: that this issue is also tracked in github as issue #275.

# Security Considerations {#security}

This document provides only information about how the TE Topology
Model, as defined in {{!RFC8795}}, can be profiled to address some
scenarios which are not considered as TE.

As such, this document does not introduce any additional security
considerations besides those already defined in {{!RFC8795}}.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

This document requires no IANA actions.
