1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] [RFC7950] is a data modeling language used to model
   configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls, and
   notifications for network management protocols such as the Network
   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].
   The YANG language supports a small set of built-in data types and
   provides mechanisms to derive other types from the built-in types.

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types              October 2025


   This document introduces a collection of common data types derived
   from the built-in YANG data types.  The derived data types,
   identities, and groupings are mainly designed to be the common
   definitions applicable for modeling Traffic Engineering (TE) features
   in model(s) defined outside of this document.  Nevertheless, these
   common definitions can be used by any other module per the guidance
   in Section 4.12 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis] and Section 4.13 of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

      Note: Some groupings defined in this document do not follow the
      guidelines of Section 4.13 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis] not to
      include "default" statements.  This is due to the fact that they
      were already defined in [RFC8776] and removing "default"
      statements is not a backward compatible change, as defined in
      Section 11 of [RFC7950].

   The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture defined in [RFC8342].

   This document adds new common data types, identities, and groupings
   to both the "ietf-te-types" and the "ietf-te-packet-types" YANG
   modules and obsoletes [RFC8776].  For further details, refer to
   Appendix B.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

1.2.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   Names of data nodes and other data model objects are prefixed using
   the standard prefix associated with the corresponding YANG imported
   modules, as shown in Table 1.

3.  Overview

   This document defines two YANG modules for common TE types: "ietf-te-
   types" for TE generic types and "ietf-te-packet-types" for packet-
   specific types.  Other technology-specific TE types are outside the
   scope of this document.

3.1.  TE Types Module Contents

   The "ietf-te-types" module (Section 4) contains common TE types that
   are independent and agnostic of any specific technology or control-
   plane instance.

3.1.1.  Identities

   The "ietf-te-types" module contains the following YANG reusable
   identities:

   path-attribute-flags:  A base YANG identity for supported LSP path
      flags as defined in [RFC3209], [RFC4090], [RFC4736], [RFC5712],
      [RFC4920], [RFC5420], [RFC7570], [RFC4875], [RFC5151], [RFC5150],
      [RFC6001], [RFC6790], [RFC7260], [RFC8001], [RFC8149], and
      [RFC8169].

   link-protection-type:  A base YANG identity for supported link
      protection types as defined in [RFC4872].

   restoration-scheme-type:  A base YANG identity for supported LSP
      restoration schemes as defined in [RFC4872].

   protection-external-commands:  A base YANG identity for supported
      protection-related external commands used for troubleshooting
      purposes, as defined in [RFC4872], [RFC6368], [RFC7271] and
      [RFC4427].

   association-type:  A base YANG identity for supported LSP association
      types as defined in [RFC6780], [RFC4872], [RFC4873], and
      [RFC8800].

   objective-function-type:  A base YANG identity for supported path

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types              October 2025


      objective functions as defined in [RFC5541].

   te-tunnel-type:  A base YANG identity for supported TE tunnel types
      as defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC4875].

   lsp-encoding-types:  A base YANG identity for supported LSP encoding
      types as defined in [RFC3471], [RFC4328] and [RFC6004].

      Additional technology-specific LSP encoding types can be defined
      in other technology-specific models.

   lsp-protection-type:  A base YANG identity for supported LSP
      protection types as defined in [RFC4872] and [RFC4873].

   switching-capabilities:  A base YANG identity for supported interface
      switching capabilities as defined in [RFC3471], [RFC6002],
      [RFC6004], [RFC7074] and [RFC7138].

      Additional technology-specific interface switching capabilities
      can be defined in other technology-specific models.

   resource-affinities-type:  A base YANG identity for supported
      attribute filters associated with a tunnel that must be satisfied
      for a link to be acceptable as defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC2702].

   path-metric-type:  A base YANG identity for supported path metric
      types as defined in [RFC3630], [RFC3785], [RFC5440], [RFC7471],
      [RFC8233], [RFC8570] and [I-D.ietf-pce-sid-algo-14].

      The unit of the path metric value is interpreted in the context of
      the path metric type.  The derived identities SHOULD describe the
      unit and maximum value of the path metric types they define.

      For example, the measurement unit is not applicable for the number
      of hops metric ('path-metric-hop').  Conversely, the bound of the
      'path-metric-loss', defined in 'ietf-te-packet-types', is defined
      in multiples of the basic unit 0.000003% as described in [RFC7471]
      and [RFC8570].

   lsp-provisioning-error-reason:  A base YANG identity for indicating
      LSP provisioning error reasons.  No standard LSP provisioning
      error reasons are defined in this document.

   path-computation-error-reason:  A base YANG identity for indicating
      path computation error reasons as defined in Section 3.1.1.1.

   protocol-origin-type:  A base YANG identity for the type of protocol
      origin as defined in Section 3.1.1.2.

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types              October 2025


   svec-objective-function-type:  A base YANG identity for supported
      SVEC objective functions as defined in [RFC5541] and [RFC8685].

   svec-metric-type:  A base YANG identity for supported SVEC objective
      functions as defined in [RFC5541].

3.1.1.1.  Path Computation Errors

   The "ietf-te-types" module contains the YANG reusable identities for
   indicating path computation error reasons as defined in [RFC5440],
   [RFC5441], [RFC5520], [RFC5557], [RFC8306], and [RFC8685].

   It also defines the following additional YANG reusable identities for
   indicating also the following path computation error reasons:

   path-computation-error-no-topology:  A YANG identity for indicating
      path computation error when there is no topology with the provided
      topology identifier.

   path-computation-error-no-dependent-server:  A YANG identity for
      indicating path computation error when one or more dependent path
      computation servers are unavailable.

      The dependent path computation server could be a Backward-
      Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) downstream PCE or a child PCE.

   The derived identities are defined in the "ietf-te-types" module,
   instead of an IANA-maintained module, because there are error reasons
   which are:

   1.  applicable only to the TE YANG models and not to PCEP
       environments (e.g., path-computation-error-no-topology);

   2.  technology-specific (e.g., No RWA constraints met) which are
       better defined in technology-specific YANG models;

   3.  match more than one PCEP numbers in order to hide the details of
       the underlay PCE architecture (e.g., path-computation-error-no-
       dependent-server).

3.1.1.2.  Protocol Origin

   The "ietf-te-types" module contains the YANG reusable identities for
   the type of protocol origin as defined in [RFC5440] and [RFC9012].

   It also defines the following additional YANG reusable identities for
   the type of protocol origin:

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types              October 2025


   protocol-origin-api:  A YANG identity to be used when the type of
      protocol origin is an Application Programmable Interface (API).

3.1.2.  Data Types

   The "ietf-te-types" module contains the following YANG reusable data
   types:

   te-ds-class:  A type representing the Differentiated Services (DS)
      Class-Type of traffic as defined in [RFC4124].

   te-label-direction:  An enumerated type for specifying the forward or
      reverse direction of a label.

   te-hop-type:  An enumerated type for specifying that a hop is loose
      or strict.

   te-global-id:  A type representing the identifier that uniquely
      identifies an operator, which can be either a provider or a
      client.  The definition of this type is taken from Section 3 of
      [RFC6370] and Section 3 of [RFC5003].  This attribute type is used
      solely to provide a globally unique context for TE topologies.

   te-node-id:  A type representing the identifier for a node in a TE
      topology.  The identifier is represented either as 4 octets in
      dotted-quad notation or as 16 octets in full, mixed, shortened, or
      shortened-mixed IPv6 address notation.

      This attribute MAY be mapped to the Router Address TLV described
      in Section 2.4.1 of [RFC3630], the TE Router ID described in
      Section 6.2 of [RFC6827], the Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV
      described in Section 4.3 of [RFC5305], or the TE Router ID TLV
      described in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC6119].

      The reachability of such a TE node MAY be achieved by a mechanism
      such as that described in Section 6.2 of [RFC6827].

   te-topology-id:  A type representing the identifier for a topology.
      It is optional to have one or more prefixes at the beginning,
      separated by colons.  The prefixes can be "network-types" as
      defined in the "ietf-network" module in [RFC8345], to help the
      user better understand the topology before further inquiry is
      made.

   te-tp-id:  A type representing the identifier of a TE interface Link
      Termination Point (LTP) on a specific TE node where the TE link
      connects.  This attribute is mapped to a local or remote link
      identifier [RFC3630] [RFC5305].

Internet-Draft            TE Common YANG Types              October 2025


   te-path-disjointness:  A type representing the different resource
      disjointness options for a TE tunnel path as defined in [RFC4872].

   admin-groups:  A union type for a TE link's classic or extended
      administrative groups as defined in [RFC3630], [RFC5305], and
      [RFC7308].

   srlg:  A type representing the Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) as
      defined in [RFC4203] and [RFC5307].

   te-metric:  A type representing the TE metric as defined in
      [RFC3785].

   te-recovery-status:  An enumerated type for the different statuses of
      a recovery action as defined in [RFC6378] and [RFC4427].

   te-link-access-type:  An enumerated type for the different TE link
      access types as defined in [RFC3630].

3.1.3.  Groupings

   The "ietf-te-types" module contains the following YANG reusable
   groupings:

   te-bandwidth:  A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE bandwidth.
      The modeling structure allows augmentation for each technology.
      For unspecified technologies, the string-encoded "te-bandwidth"
      type is used.

   te-label:  A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE label.  The
      modeling structure allows augmentation for each technology.  For
      unspecified technologies, "rt-types:generalized-label" is used.

   performance-metrics-attributes:  A YANG grouping that defines one-way
      and two-way measured Performance Metrics (PM) and indications of
      anomalies on link(s) or the path as defined in [RFC7471],
      [RFC8570], and [RFC7823].

   performance-metrics-throttle-container:  A YANG grouping that defines
      configurable thresholds for advertisement suppression and
      measurement intervals.

   explicit-route-hop:  A YANG grouping that defines supported explicit
      routes as defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC3477].

   explicit-route-hop-with-srlg:  A YANG grouping that augments the
      'explicit-route-hop' to specify also Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG)
      hops.

   encoding-and-switching-type:  This is a common grouping to define the
      LSP encoding and switching types.

3.2.  Packet TE Types Module Contents

   The "ietf-te-packet-types" module (Section 5) covers the common types
   and groupings that are specific to packet technology.

3.2.1.  Identities

   The "ietf-te-packet-types" module contains the following YANG
   reusable identities:

   backup-protection-type:  A base YANG identity for supported
      protection types that a backup or bypass tunnel can provide as
      defined in [RFC4090].

   bc-model-type:  A base YANG identity for supported Diffserv-TE
      Bandwidth Constraints Models as defined in [RFC4125], [RFC4126],
      and [RFC4127].

   bandwidth-profile-type:  A base YANG identity for various bandwidth
      profiles specified in [MEF_10.3], [RFC2697] and [RFC2698] that may
      be used to limit bandwidth utilization of packet flows (e.g.,
      MPLS-TE LSPs).

3.2.2.  Data Types

   The "ietf-te-packet-types" module contains the following YANG
   reusable data types:

   te-bandwidth-requested-type:  An enumerated type for the different
      options to request bandwidth for a specific tunnel.

3.2.3.  Groupings

   The "ietf-te-packet-types" module contains the following YANG
   reusable groupings:

   performance-metrics-attributes-packet:  A YANG grouping that contains
      the generic performance metrics and additional packet-specific
      metrics.

   bandwidth-profile-parameters:  A YANG grouping that defines common
      parameters for bandwidth profiles in packet networks.

   te-packet-path-bandwidth:  A YANG grouping that defines the path

      bandwidth information and could be used in any Packet TE model
      (e.g., MPLS-TE topology model) for the path bandwidth
      representation (e.g., the bandwidth of an MPLS-TE LSP).

      All the path and LSP bandwidth related sections in the "ietf-te-
      types" generic module, Section 4, need to be augmented with this
      grouping for the usage of Packet TE technologies.

   te-packet-link-bandwidth:  A YANG grouping that defines the link
      bandwidth information and could be used in any Packet TE model
      (e.g., MPLS-TE topology) for link bandwidth representation.

      All the link bandwidth related sections in the "ietf-te-types"
      generic module, Section 4, need to be augmented with this grouping
      for the usage of Packet TE technologies.

4.  TE Types YANG Module

   The "ietf-te-types" module imports from the following modules:

   *  "ietf-yang-types" and "ietf-inet-types" as defined in [RFC6991]

   *  "ietf-routing-types" as defined in [RFC8294]

   In addition to [RFC6991] and [RFC8294], this module references the
   following documents in defining the types and YANG groupings:
   [RFC9522], [RFC4090], [RFC4202], [RFC4328], [RFC4561], [RFC4657],

            This is represented in big endian as 'hex-string'.

7.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-te-types" and the "ietf-te-packet-types" YANG modules
   define data models that are designed to be accessed via YANG-based
   management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  These protocols have to use a secure transport layer
   (e.g., SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and QUIC [RFC9000]) and have to
   use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The YANG modules define a set of identities, types, and groupings.
   These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG modules.  The
   modules by themselves do not expose any data nodes that are writable,
   data nodes that contain read-only state, or RPCs.  As such, there are
   no additional security issues related to the YANG module that need to
   be considered.

   Modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
   should identify the corresponding security considerations.  For
   example using 'explicit-route-hop', 'record-route-state' or 'te-
   topology-identifier' (which includes the 'client-id') groupings may
   expose sensitive topology information.

   This appendix presents the complete tree of the TE and Packet TE
   types data model.  See [RFC8340] for an explanation of the symbols
   used.  The data type of every leaf node is shown near the right end
   of the corresponding line.

      Editors' Note: The YANG trees have been generated by pyang and
      have some bugs to be fixed before publication.  Please manually
      fix the YANG tree before sending the document to the RFC EDITOR.

Appendix B.  Changes from RFC 8776

   This version adds new common data types, identities, and groupings to
   the YANG modules.  It also updates some of the existing data types,
   identities, and groupings in the YANG modules and fixes few bugs in
   [RFC8776].

   The following new identities have been added to the 'ietf-te-types'
   module:

   *  lsp-provisioning-error-reason;

   *  association-type-diversity;

   *  action-exercise (bug fix);

   *  path-metric-type:

      new base identities have been added;

   *  path-metric-te (bug fix);

      The following new leaves have been added to the 'explicit-route-
      hop' grouping:

      -  node-id-uri;

      -  link-tp-id-uri;

      The following leaves, already defined in [RFC8776], have been
      updated in the 'explicit-route-hop':

      -  node-id;

      -  link-tp-id.

         The mandatory true statements for the node-id and link-tp-id
         have been replaced by must statements that requires at least
         the presence of:

         o  node-id or node-id-uri;

         o  link-tp-id or link-tp-id-uri.

   *  explicit-route-hop

      The following new leaves have been added to the 'explicit-route-
      hop' grouping:

      -  node-id-uri;

      -  link-tp-id-uri;

      The following leaves, already defined in [RFC8776], have been
      updated in the 'explicit-route-hop':

      -  node-id;

      -  link-tp-id.

         The mandatory true statements for the node-id and link-tp-id
         have been replaced by must statements that requires at least
         the presence of:

      The following leaves, already defined in [RFC8776], have been
      updated in the 'optimization-metric-entry':

      -  metric-type;

         The base identity has been updated without impacting the set of
         derived identities that are allowed.

   *  tunnel-constraints;

      The following new leaf have been added to the 'tunnel-constraints'
      grouping:

      -  network-id;

   *  path-constraints-route-objects:

      The following container, already defined in [RFC8776], has been
      updated in the 'path-constraints-route-objects':

      -  explicit-route-objects-always;

         The container has been renamed as 'explicit-route-objects'.
         This change is not affecting any IETF standard YANG models
         since this grouping has not yet been used by any YANG model
         defined in existing IETF RFCs.

   *  generic-path-metric-bounds:

      The following leaves, already defined in [RFC8776], have been
      updated in the 'optimization-metric-entry':

      -  metric-type;

         The base identity has been updated to:

         o  increase the set of derived identities that are allowed and;

         o  remove from this set the 'path-metric-optimize-includes' and
            the 'path-metric-optimize-excludes' identities (bug fixing)

   *  generic-path-optimization

      The following new leaf have been added to the 'generic-path-
      optimization' grouping:

      -  tiebreaker;

      The following container, already defined in [RFC8776], has been
      deprecated:

      -  tiebreakers.

   The following identities, already defined in [RFC8776], have been
   obsoleted in the 'ietf-te-types' module for bug fixing:

   *  of-minimize-agg-bandwidth-consumption;

   *  of-minimize-load-most-loaded-link;

   *  of-minimize-cost-path-set;
