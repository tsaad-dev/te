--- abstract

This document defines a collection of common data types, identities, and groupings in YANG data modeling language. These derived common data types, identities and groupings are intended to be imported by other modules, e.g., those which model the Traffic Engineering (TE) configuration and state capabilities.

This document obsoletes RFC 8776.

# Introduction

YANG {{!RFC6020}} {{!RFC7950}} is a data modeling language used to model configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls, and notifications for network management protocols such as the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) {{?RFC6241}} or RESTCONF {{?RFC8040}}. The YANG language supports a small set of built-in data types and provides mechanisms to derive other types from the built-in types.

This document introduces a collection of common data types derived from the built-in YANG data types. The derived data types, identities, and groupings are mainly designed to be the common definitions applicable for modeling Traffic Engineering (TE) features in model(s) defined outside of this document. Nevertheless, these common definitions can be used by any other module per the guidance in {{Section 4.12 of ?I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis}} and {{Section 4.13 of ?I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis}}.

> Note: Some groupings defined in this document do not always follow the suggestion in
{{Section 4.13 of ?I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis}} not to include
"default" statements. This is due to the fact that they were already defined in {{?RFC8876}} and removing "default"
statements is not a backward compatible change, as defined in {{Section 11 of !RFC7950}}.

The YANG data model in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture defined in {{!RFC8342}}.

This document adds new common data types, identities, and groupings to both the "ietf-te-types" and the "ietf-te-packet-types" YANG modules and obsoletes {{!RFC8776}}. For further details, refer to {{changes-bis}}.

# Overview {#overview}

This document defines two YANG modules for common TE types: "ietf-te-types" for TE generic types and "ietf-te-packet-types" for packet-specific types. Other technology-specific TE types are outside the scope of this document.

## TE Types Module Contents

The "ietf-te-types" module ({{te-yang-code}}) contains common TE types that are independent and agnostic of any specific technology or control-plane instance.

### Identities

The "ietf-te-types" module contains the following YANG reusable identities:

path-attribute-flags:
: A base YANG identity for supported LSP path flags as defined in {{!RFC3209}}, {{!RFC4090}}, {{?RFC4736}}, {{!RFC5712}}, {{!RFC4920}}, {{!RFC5420}}, {{!RFC7570}}, {{!RFC4875}}, {{!RFC5151}}, {{!RFC5150}}, {{!RFC6001}}, {{!RFC6790}}, {{!RFC7260}}, {{!RFC8001}}, {{!RFC8149}}, and {{!RFC8169}}.

link-protection-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported link protection types as defined in {{!RFC4872}}.

restoration-scheme-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported LSP restoration schemes as defined in {{!RFC4872}}.

protection-external-commands:
: A base YANG identity for supported protection-related external commands used for troubleshooting purposes, as defined in {{!RFC4872}}, {{!RFC6368}}, {{!RFC7271}} and {{?RFC4427}}.

association-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported LSP association types as defined in {{!RFC6780}}, {{!RFC4872}}, {{!RFC4873}}, and {{!RFC8800}}.

objective-function-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported path objective functions as defined in {{!RFC5541}}.

te-tunnel-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported TE tunnel types as defined in {{!RFC3209}} and {{!RFC4875}}.

lsp-encoding-types:
: A base YANG identity for supported LSP encoding types as defined in {{!RFC3471}}, {{!RFC4328}} and {{!RFC6004}}.
: Additional technology-specific LSP encoding types can be defined in other technology-specific models.

lsp-protection-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported LSP protection types as defined in {{!RFC4872}} and {{!RFC4873}}.

switching-capabilities:
: A base YANG identity for supported interface switching capabilities as defined in {{!RFC3471}}, {{!RFC6002}}, {{!RFC6004}}, {{!RFC7074}} and {{!RFC7138}}.
: Additional technology-specific interface switching capabilities can be defined in other technology-specific models.

resource-affinities-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported attribute filters associated with a tunnel that must be satisfied for a link to be acceptable as defined in {{!RFC3209}} and {{?RFC2702}}.

path-metric-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported path metric types as defined in {{!RFC3630}}, {{!RFC3785}}, {{!RFC5440}}, {{!RFC7471}}, {{!RFC8233}}, {{!RFC8570}} and {{?I-D.ietf-pce-sid-algo-14}}.
: The unit of the path metric value is interpreted in the context of the path metric type. The derived identities SHOULD describe the unit and maximum value of the path metric types they define.
: For example, the measurement unit is not applicable for the number of hops metric ('path-metric-hop'). Conversely, the bound of the 'path-metric-loss', defined in 'ietf-te-packet-types', is defined in multiples of the basic unit 0.000003% as described in {{!RFC7471}} and {{!RFC8570}}.

lsp-provisioning-error-reason:
: A base YANG identity for indicating LSP provisioning error reasons. No standard LSP provisioning error reasons are defined in this document.

path-computation-error-reason:
: A base YANG identity for indicating path computation error reasons as defined in {{pc-error}}.

protocol-origin-type:
: A base YANG identity for the type of protocol origin as defined in {{protocol-origin}}.

svec-objective-function-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported SVEC objective functions as defined in {{!RFC5541}} and {{!RFC8685}}.

svec-metric-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported SVEC objective functions as defined in {{!RFC5541}}.

#### Path Computation Errors {#pc-error}

The "ietf-te-types" module contains the YANG reusable identities for indicating path computation error reasons as defined in {{!RFC5440}}, {{!RFC5441}}, {{!RFC5520}}, {{!RFC5557}}, {{!RFC8306}}, and {{!RFC8685}}.

It also defines the following additional YANG reusable identities for indicating also the following path computation error reasons:

path-computation-error-no-topology:
: A YANG identity for indicating path computation error when there is no topology with the provided topology identifier.

path-computation-error-no-dependent-server:
: A YANG identity for indicating path computation error when one or more dependent path computation servers are unavailable.
: The dependent path computation server could be a Backward-Recursive Path Computation (BRPC) downstream PCE or a child PCE.

The derived identities are defined in the "ietf-te-types" module, instead of an IANA-maintained module, because there are error reasons which are:

1. applicable only to the TE YANG models and not to PCEP environments (e.g., path-computation-error-no-topology);
1. technology-specific (e.g., No RWA constraints met) which are better defined in technology-specific YANG models;
1. match more than one PCEP numbers in order to hide the details of the underlay PCE architecture (e.g., path-computation-error-no-dependent-server).

#### Protocol Origin {#protocol-origin}

The "ietf-te-types" module contains the YANG reusable identities for the type of protocol origin as defined in {{!RFC5440}} and {{!RFC9012}}.

It also defines the following additional YANG reusable identities for the type of protocol origin:

protocol-origin-api:
: A YANG identity to be used when the type of protocol origin is an Application Programmable Interface (API).

### Data Types

The "ietf-te-types" module contains the following YANG reusable data types:

te-ds-class:
: A type representing the Differentiated Services (DS) Class-Type of traffic as defined in {{!RFC4124}}.

te-label-direction:
: An enumerated type for specifying the forward or reverse direction of a label.

te-hop-type:
: An enumerated type for specifying that a hop is loose or strict.

te-global-id:
: A type representing the identifier that uniquely identifies an operator, which can be either a provider or a client. The definition of this type is taken from {{Section 3 of !RFC6370}} and {{Section 3 of !RFC5003}}. This attribute type is used solely to provide a globally unique context for TE topologies.

te-node-id:
: A type representing the identifier for a node in a TE topology. The identifier is represented either as 4 octets in dotted-quad notation or as 16 octets in full, mixed, shortened, or shortened-mixed IPv6 address notation.
: This attribute MAY be mapped to the Router Address TLV described in {{Section 2.4.1 of !RFC3630}}, the TE Router ID described in {{Section 6.2 of !RFC6827}}, the Traffic Engineering Router ID TLV described in {{Section 4.3 of !RFC5305}}, or the TE Router ID TLV described in {{Section 3.2.1 of !RFC6119}}.
: The reachability of such a TE node MAY be achieved by a mechanism such as that described in {{Section 6.2 of !RFC6827}}.

te-topology-id:
: A type representing the identifier for a topology. It is optional to have one or more prefixes at the beginning, separated by colons. The prefixes can be "network-types" as defined in the "ietf-network" module in {{!RFC8345}}, to help the user better understand the topology before further inquiry is made.

te-tp-id:
: A type representing the identifier of a TE interface Link Termination Point (LTP) on a specific TE node where the TE link connects. This attribute is mapped to a local or remote link identifier {{!RFC3630}} {{!RFC5305}}.

te-path-disjointness:
: A type representing the different resource disjointness options for a TE tunnel path as defined in {{!RFC4872}}.

admin-groups:
: A union type for a TE link's classic or extended administrative groups as defined in {{!RFC3630}}, {{!RFC5305}}, and {{!RFC7308}}.

srlg:
: A type representing the Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) as defined in {{!RFC4203}} and {{!RFC5307}}.

te-metric:
: A type representing the TE metric as defined in {{!RFC3785}}.

te-recovery-status:
: An enumerated type for the different statuses of a recovery action as defined in {{!RFC6378}} and {{?RFC4427}}.

te-link-access-type:
: An enumerated type for the different TE link access types as defined in {{!RFC3630}}.

### Groupings

The "ietf-te-types" module contains the following YANG reusable groupings:

te-bandwidth:
: A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE bandwidth. The modeling structure allows augmentation for each technology. For unspecified technologies, the string-encoded "te-bandwidth" type is used.

te-label:
: A YANG grouping that defines the generic TE label. The modeling structure allows augmentation for each technology. For unspecified technologies, "rt-types:generalized-label" is used.

performance-metrics-attributes:
: A YANG grouping that defines one-way and two-way measured Performance Metrics (PM) and indications of anomalies on link(s) or the path as defined in {{!RFC7471}}, {{!RFC8570}}, and {{?RFC7823}}.

performance-metrics-throttle-container:
: A YANG grouping that defines configurable thresholds for advertisement suppression and measurement intervals.

explicit-route-hop:
: A YANG grouping that defines supported explicit routes as defined in {{!RFC3209}} and {{!RFC3477}}.

explicit-route-hop-with-srlg:
: A YANG grouping that augments the 'explicit-route-hop' to specify also Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) hops.

encoding-and-switching-type:
: This is a common grouping to define the LSP encoding and switching types.

## Packet TE Types Module Contents

The "ietf-te-packet-types" module ({{pkt-yang-code}}) covers the common types and groupings that are specific to packet technology.

### Identities

The "ietf-te-packet-types" module contains the following YANG reusable identities:

backup-protection-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported protection types that a backup or bypass tunnel can provide as defined in {{!RFC4090}}.

bc-model-type:
: A base YANG identity for supported Diffserv-TE Bandwidth Constraints Models as defined in {{?RFC4125}}, {{?RFC4126}}, and {{?RFC4127}}.

bandwidth-profile-type:
: A base YANG identity for various bandwidth profiles specified in {{MEF_10.3}}, {{?RFC2697}} and {{?RFC2698}} that may be used to limit bandwidth utilization of packet flows (e.g., MPLS-TE LSPs).

### Data Types

The "ietf-te-packet-types" module contains the following YANG reusable data types:

te-bandwidth-requested-type:
: An enumerated type for the different options to request bandwidth for a specific tunnel.

### Groupings

The "ietf-te-packet-types" module contains the following YANG reusable groupings:

performance-metrics-attributes-packet:
: A YANG grouping that contains the generic performance metrics and additional packet-specific metrics.

bandwidth-profile-parameters:
: A YANG grouping that defines common parameters for bandwidth profiles in packet networks.

te-packet-path-bandwidth:
: A YANG grouping that defines the path bandwidth information and could be used in any Packet TE model (e.g., MPLS-TE topology model) for the path bandwidth representation (e.g., the bandwidth of an MPLS-TE LSP).
: All the path and LSP bandwidth related sections in the "ietf-te-types" generic module, {{te-yang-code}}, need to be augmented with this grouping for the usage of Packet TE technologies.

te-packet-link-bandwidth:
: A YANG grouping that defines the link bandwidth information and could be used in any Packet TE model (e.g., MPLS-TE topology) for link bandwidth representation.
: All the link bandwidth related sections in the "ietf-te-types" generic module, {{te-yang-code}}, need to be augmented with this grouping for the usage of Packet TE technologies.

# Security Considerations

This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
of {{?I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis}}.

The "ietf-te-types" and the "ietf-te-packet-types" YANG modules define data models that are
designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
NETCONF {{?RFC6241}} and RESTCONF {{?RFC8040}}. These protocols have to
use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH {{?RFC4252}}, TLS {{?RFC8446}}, and
QUIC {{?RFC9000}}) and have to use mutual authentication.

The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) {{!RFC8341}}
provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

The YANG modules define a set of identities, types, and
groupings. These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG
modules. The modules by themselves do not expose any data nodes that
are writable, data nodes that contain read-only state, or RPCs.
As such, there are no additional security issues related to
the YANG module that need to be considered.

Modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
should identify the corresponding security considerations.
For example using 'explicit-route-hop', 'record-route-state' or 'te-topology-identifier' groupings may expose sensitive topology information, such as the 'client-id' of a client the TE topology is customized for, as defined in {{Section 5.4 of !RFC8795}}.
